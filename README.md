# Mobile Flashcard Project

This is the complete version of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

The objective of this project is to build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This application have been tested on iOS only.
